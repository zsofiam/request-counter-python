# Request counter

## Story

This assignment is a list of exercises for practicing Flask.
You can find multiple features which you can accomplish separately after the Preparation part.
Do not forget to commit after you completed a part.

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn and practice how to do the following things:

- Send HTTP requests with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE method
- Use global variables with Flask and display their value on a page
- Write different behaviors for different HTTP methods on the same endpoint

## Tasks

1. Initialize an empty Flask project with a new virtualenv and a `.gitignore` file.
    - Student has a `venv` folder containing a virtual environment with at least python 3.6
    - Student has a `requirements.txt` with Flask as one of the requirements
    - Student has a `templates` folder for your html template files
    - Student has a `server.py` where you can handle incoming HTTP requests
    - Student has a `.gitignore` file which ignores unnecessary venv/pyCharm/Flask/python files

2. Create a `/` route for the main page from which users can reach the features of the Request counter.
    - The page has a GET-Request link that sends a GET request to the `/request-counter` route
    - The page has a POST-Request button (in a form) that sends a POST request to the `/request-counter` route
    - The page has a Statistics link that navigates to the `/statistics` route

3. Create a `/request-counter` route that can count incoming HTTP requests.
    - Numbers of requests are stored for each HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) in separate global variables
    - After increasing the count this route redirects to main page

4. Create a `/statistics` route which can show the count results.
    - The page has a link which leads back to to home page
    - The page has a table which contains 4 rows (one for each HTTP method) and two columns (one for the method name and one for the request count)

5. Store the request count data in a text file instead of global variable.
    - Student has a text file named `request_counts.txt`
    - The `request_counts.txt`'s content should look like this:
GET: 5
POST: 3
DELETE: 1
PUT: 0

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can send PUT and DELETE requests with Curl. This way you can try your request counter with all HTTP methods to make sure it works.
